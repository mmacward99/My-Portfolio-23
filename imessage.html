        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          This project was an app redesign I did in my SMAD 308 class in college. When I first constructed this project I thought I understood the idea behind it, but while updating my portfolio, I noticed that with 10 months under my belt, I could do a lot better. I decided to take this case study and improve it with the skills I’ve picked up since graduating in 2022. 
          
          Most people rely heavily on this app in order to communicate with others. Apple users can create group chats with up to 25 individuals, including non-Apple users. More recently companies have been utilizing text messages as a way to let customers know about promotions, updates, and more. Users can receive a myriad of different messages from day to day. I chose to create a new design for iMessage, to allow users to group the messages they receive into categories. </p>

    <h2>Goal (Improved)</h2>
    <p>Redesign the iMessage to allow for users to organize their messages based on contact type and date of message. </p>

    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>This study included 31 indiviudals that were Apple users spanning from 20 up to 50+ years of age. 61.3% of users stated that they had difficulty when looking back to locate old messages, while 93.5% stated that creating categories in the Messages app would make it easier to locate messages. A majority of users stated that they used the Messages app for family and friends text messages, but almost half of the users said they also recieved promotional messages via the Messages app.</p>

      <h2>User Research (Improved)</h2>
      <p>Looking back on these user research questions, It’s evident I had an idea in my head of what I wanted to change. This lead me to ask questions based on my own pain points with iMessage, rather than finding out what was a problem for the majority of users taking the survey. If I were to conduct this user research today, I would scrap the first two questions. Instead I would asks questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What are the main issues you run into when using the iMessage app on your iPhone?”</li>
        <li>“Who do you communicate with using iMessage?”</li>
        <li>“What features do you like most about the iMessage app?</li>
        <li>“What features do you like least?”</li>
        <li>“Do you use any other messaging apps, if so, what do you like about them?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In comparison to my previous research questions, these questions are more open ended, they allow for more information to be shared. They also do not steer the user to lean any which way.</p>

        <h2>Design Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>There is a lack of distinguishing between different kinds of messages. Group chats, personal messages, work messages, etc. all look very similar. The only distinguishing feature is the name or the icon and not everyone uses Bitmojis. While you do have the ability to pin specific people and groups there is a limited number before half your screen is taken up by the pinned individuals. Another important issue within the app is the organization of messages by date. While messages do have a time or date on them, finding old texts requires the user to scroll through a sea of text threads.</p>

        <h2>Redesign</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>In order to better understand the changes I made in my redesign, I created a wireframe of the new layout. With each group of contacts that you create, their messages are organized from newest to oldest.</p>

<div class="row" style="padding:50px;">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h2>Mockups</h2>
        <p>One of the main issues that arised in my research was the lack of organization in the Messages app. In order to address this issues I created different groups of contacts that you could pin rather than just a single person or single group chat. I used different colors for each group of contacts so that their contact could be distinguished from other.</p>
        <p>I added a category of contacts called "recents" which you allow users to see messages order for newest to oldest. In the redesign I put messges into categories such as "Today", "This Week", "This Month", and so on. This was implemented in the "Recents" group, as well as every other group the user creates within the app.</p>
        <p>Another problem I addressed in my redesign was sizing. When you pin a contact at the top of the Messages app, they are all the same size. Creating a larger circle for the group of contacts you have selected allows for easier navigation. I also thought it would be best for user navigation if each of the groups created were automatically pinned at the top of the app. This way if you would like to search for messages from an employee, you can easily click the "work" group instead of mindlessly scrolling through thousands of old text threads.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the process of redesigning this user flow for the Messages app on Apple iPhone. I have always had issues with finding old messages or contacts in a fast and efficient way. I think that this redesign could provide for easier use and more creativity among users of the app!</p>
